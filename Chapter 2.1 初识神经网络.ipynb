Precisely, layers extract representations out of the data fed into them -- hopefully representations that are more meaningful for the problem at hand. Most of deep learning really consists of chaining together simple layers which will implement a form of progressive \"data distillation\"(渐进式的数据蒸馏). A deep learning model is like a sieve (筛子) for data processing, made of a succession of increasingly refined data filters -- the \"layers\".\n",

Each score will be the probability that the current digit image belongs to one of our 10 digit classes.\n",
